    			<p>Hello and welcome to <b><em>Teachinggum</b></em> and the aim of this site is to provide a guide to the best resources available on the internet for learning English.<br>How times have changed.Nowadays, learners of English have access to an unlimited amount of authentic material in the form of online news, blogs, e-books, podcasts, YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, Twitter, etc. Not to mention all the sites and resources specifically aimed at English learners. And you don't even have to be sitting in front of a computer any longer â€” mobile learning on smartphones and tablets has become commonplace. With this wealth of material, one might think that it would be much easier to learn the language. The problem is that the sheer amount of material can be overwhelming. How can you find the most suitable English-learning resources for your level and needs.<br> The good news is that I have done a lot of the work for you.That's why I decided to create a new site: <strong><em>Teachinggum</strong></em> .</p>
